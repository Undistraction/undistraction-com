I'm Pedr, a Front End Developer and Designer based in Newcastle Upon Tyne in the North of England. I love concise, readable and well tested code and minimal design where content is king.

I've been working as a designer and developer for over ten years and I'm well versed in JavaScript, CSS and a good chunk of Rails. I've also developed some non-trivial iOS apps (though not for a while) and I'm currently dabbling with a little Haskell. Over the years I've worked for a huge variety of customers from high-street fashion brands, high-end design agencies and startups to social enterprise, NGOs and theatre companies on websites and both web and mobile apps.

I'm a big fan of CSS-in-JS and functional programming and I am one of the core contributors to [Ramda Adjunct](https://github.com/char0n/ramda-adjunct), the most popular extension library for Ramda, the gold standard in JavaScript FP libraries, and I've contributed to a number of other open-source projects including [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I have recently taken some time out to improve my skills through working on a number of my own open-source projects.

If you'd like to see the code I write you can take a look at my [Github Account](https://github.com/Undistraction) and to see what I've been stuggling with recently have a look at my [Stack Overflow Profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/138601/undistraction) (I'm in the top 2% of contributors and my questions and answers have reached around 1.6 million people).

Last year I co-edited the official Webpack book [SurviveJS:Webpack](https://survivejs.com/webpack/foreword/) written by Juho Vepsäläinen, one of the core Webpack team.

Alongside writing code I sometimes do print work, photography and the occasional music video which you can see at my other site [unwalked.com](http://unwalked.com).
