I'm Pedr, an experienced Front End Developer and Designer based in Newcastle
Upon Tyne in the North of England. I love concise, readable and well tested code
and minimal design where content is king.

I've been working as a designer and developer for over ten years and I'm well
versed in JavaScript, CSS and a good chunk of Rails. I've also developed some
non-trivial iOS apps (though not for a while) and I'm currently dabbling with a
little Haskell. Over the years I've worked for a huge variety of customers from
high-street fashion brands, high-end design agencies and startups to social
enterprise, NGOs and theatre companies on websites and both web and mobile apps.

I'm a big fan of CSS-in-JS and functional programming and I am one of the core
contributors to [Ramda Adjunct](https://github.com/char0n/ramda-adjunct), the
most popular extension library for Ramda, the gold standard in JavaScript FP
libraries, and I've contributed to a number of other open-source projects
including [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I have recently taken some time out to improve my skills through working on a
number of my own open-source projects.

* [cssapi](https://github.com/Undistraction/cssapi) provides sites and apps
  using CSS-in-JS with a simple mechanism for defining, managing and accessing
  values used throughout their styles and across breakpoints, improving
  consistency and flexibility.
* [gatsby-starter-skeleton](https://github.com/Undistraction/gatsby-starter-skeleton)
  is a full-featured starter for use with Gatsby
* [gatsby-plugin-node-fields](https://github.com/Undistraction/gatsby-plugin-node-fields)
  is a plugin for Gatsby offering a simple API for defining defaults,
  transforming and validating node values.
* [folktale-validations](https://github.com/Undistraction/folktale-validations)
  is a comprehensive functional validation framework for simple value and
  recursive-object validation and transformation using Folktale's Validation
  Monad and supporting object schemas.
* [cssapi-mq](https://github.com/Undistraction/cssapi-mq) is a fully-featured
  and flexible API for rendering Media Queries in CSS-in-JS applications.
* [jasmine-multline-matchers](https://github.com/Undistraction/jasmine-multiline-matchers)
  are a set of Jest / Jasmine matchers for matching against multiline strings.
* [grid-model](https://github.com/Undistraction/grid-model) is a small library
  for modeling a grid and accessing its metrics.

If you'd like to see the code I write you can take a look at my
[Github Account](https://github.com/Undistraction) and to see what I've been
stuggling with recently have a look at my
[Stack Overflow Profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/138601/undistraction)
(I'm in the top 2% of contributors and my questions and answers have reached
around 1.6 million people).

Last year I co-edited the official Webpack book
[SurviveJS:Webpack](https://survivejs.com/webpack/foreword/) written by Juho
Vepsäläinen, one of the core Webpack team.

Alongside writing code I sometimes do print work, photography and the occasional
music video which you can see over at [unwalked.com](http://unwalked.com).
