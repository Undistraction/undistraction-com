        In over 15 years of experience, I can count on one hand the people I
        would be 100% confident in recommending, but Pedrâ€™s always first on my
        list. His creative eye, attention to detail in design, and his ability
        to craft readable and reliable code is second-to-none. Always passionate
        about his work and a good communicator, he would be a valuable asset to
        any company.
