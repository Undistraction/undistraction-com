I’m a software developer with 20 years experience working across web development and design, with the last nine years focussed on the front-end within the React ecosystem. Prior to this, I spent a significant amount of time working across the Rails stack, designing, building and styling components, sites and front-ends.

I’m comfortable working with JavaScript or TypeScript, and styling with vanilla CSS through to Styled Components and Tailwind. I’ve worked with both REST and GraphQL APIs, and more recently I’ve been playing with NextJS and HTMX. I am a big fan of testing and I’ve used a variety of testing tooling over the years, including vitest, Jest, Cypress and Playwright.

Most recently I spent almost six years working for a digital-health startup, architecting and building multiple admin and service-user-facing front-ends. Prior to that I worked as a contractor for a wide variety of clients, from health data platforms and branding consultancies to high-street retailers and educational institutions. I’m very comfortable working remotely, autonomously or as part of a team, I’m adaptable, and can pick up new technologies and working practices quickly.

I’ll always advocate for well specified and carefully considered code, but experience has made me pragmatic and I understand that the needs of a business can dictate a variety of approaches to development. I love writing code, but also solving UX and design problems. I greatly enjoy both learning and teaching, and have mentored a number of junior developers over the years.

I favour a more functional approach to code, with data and functions kept separate, but with a very pragmatic slant, emphasising code that is well structured, easy to read and easy to reason about. Somewhat unusually I also enjoy writing specifications and documentation.

I’ve contributed to a number of open-source projects over the years including Ramda-adjunct and Gatsby, and co-edited ‘SurviveJS – Webpack 5’, the official guide to using Webpack.

Outside of work, I love the outdoors, especially long-distance hiking and camping in wild country. I also play accoustic and electric guitar and I'm learning the bass, and spend a lot of time making and listening to music.
